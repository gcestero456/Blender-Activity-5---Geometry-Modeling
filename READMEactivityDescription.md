# Blender-Activity-5---Geometry-Modeling
Gustavo Cestero:

For checkpoint 1, I chose from Turbosquid a Tie Fighter model, a popular ship from Star Wars.

For checkpoint 2, I implemented sculpting into the model of the tie fighter to give out the effect of a damaged and battle scarred ship; with parts of it's wings being 
bent and the hull of the ship being very dented.
